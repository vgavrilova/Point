# Point

Hello everyone!

In this code the points are represented in 2D space. I've created this project for a better understanding of classes and constructors
in Java.

In this program you can calculate: <br>
a) the distance between the inserted point and the point(0,0) <br>
b) the distance between the inserted point and the point(x,y) <br>
c) the distance between the inserted point and any other point of your choice <br>


Let me know if you have any remaks and/or suggestions how to improve this code. Thanks in advance!


Have fun!
