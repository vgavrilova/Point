# Point

Hello everyone!

In this code the points are represented in 2D space. I've created this project for better understanding of classes and constructors
in Java.

In this procram you can calculate: <br>
a) the distance between the inserted point and the point(0,0) <br>
b) the distance between the inserted point and the point(x,y) <br>
c) the distance between the inserted point and any other point of your choice <br>


Let me know if you have any remaks and/or suggestions how to improve this code. Thanks in advance!


Have fun!
